# LearningD

This is the example source code from the book _Learning D_ ([Amazon][1], [Packt][2]). The _Release_ branch contains the original code exactly as it was released with the book. Bugfixes and changes will be applied only to the master branch. This is intended to ensure the code remains up to date and compilable with future releases of DMD.

The code was originally developed with DMD 2.067.1. Examples using DUB require DUB 0.9.24 or later.
