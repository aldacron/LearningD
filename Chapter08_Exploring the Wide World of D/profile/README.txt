Compile main.d in this directory with -profile, then execute the binary. This will produce two files: trace.def and trace.log. The former contains a list of all of the functions called in the program. The latter is a set of profile information for each function, including the number of times called, the total time (in microseconds) spend in the call, and the average number of microseconds per call.
